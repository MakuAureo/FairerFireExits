# Fairer Fire Exits
> This mod is a sub-section of code from another mod that I felt deserved it's own mod

Don't you hate when you just got in main, look to the side and see your fellow team mates who just got in fire? You can fix that now!

This mod solves that by making sure fire exits can't spawn too close to main, for interiors with more than one fire exit they might spawn closer to each other, but the distribution should make it so that isn't very likely.

#### Note
This mod changes Dungeon Generation and thus is required by everyone in the lobby to avoid desync
